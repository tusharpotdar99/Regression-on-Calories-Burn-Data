# Regression-on-Calories-Burn-Data

I performed linear regression on calories burned data using various regression methods, including multiple linear regression, polynomial regression, ridge regression, Lasso regression, ElasticNet regression, and SGD regressor. The objective was to predict the calories burned based on various features.

Multiple Linear Regression: This method involves fitting a linear model to predict the target variable (calories burned) using multiple predictor variables. The model achieved an accuracy above 95%.

Polynomial Regression: Polynomial regression extends the multiple linear regression model by introducing polynomial features. This allows for more complex relationships between the features and the target variable. In this case, the polynomial regression model achieved an accuracy of 99%, indicating a strong fit to the data.

Ridge Regression: Ridge regression is a regularized version of linear regression that adds a penalty term to the loss function to prevent overfitting. It performed well, achieving an accuracy above 95%.

Lasso Regression: Lasso regression is another regularized regression method that uses L1 regularization. It performed similarly to ridge regression, with an accuracy above 95%.

ElasticNet Regression: ElasticNet regression combines the penalties of ridge and Lasso regression. It provides a balance between the L1 and L2 penalties. Like ridge and Lasso regression, it achieved an accuracy above 95%.

SGD Regressor: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) regressor is an optimization algorithm used for fitting linear regression models. It also achieved an accuracy above 95%.

Additionally, I evaluated the performance of each model using cross-validation, both with and without scaled data and polynomial features. Scaling the data can be beneficial for certain algorithms, particularly those that are sensitive to the scale of the features. Polynomial features can capture non-linear relationships between the features and the target variable, potentially improving model performance.

Based on the results, the polynomial regression model stood out with the highest accuracy of 99%. However, it's essential to consider the trade-offs, as more complex models like polynomial regression may be prone to overfitting, especially if the dataset is small. Therefore, it's crucial to balance model complexity with performance and interpretability.
